# Project01-Simon-Game

##Technologies Used:

    1. Basic html (<div>, #id, .class, <script>, <link>, <p>, <h1>)
    2. CSS (display flex, flex direction, border, radius, linear gradient, )
    3. JavaScript:
       - Used "let" to declared global variables.
       - Used "for loop" and "Math.floor, Math.random" for random pattern of each stages.
       -  Used Vanilla JavaScript method ("document.getElementById") and .play() method to declared and make it play each sound effects.
       - Used jQuery selection $()function to find specific element or selection.
       - Used .html() and .css() to change texts of "p" or "h1" and styles to appear differently under different conditions.
       - Used setTimeout(function, milliseconds) to executes a function, after waiting a specified number of time.
       - Used .pop(), .shift(), .push()

##Approach Taken:

     In order to complete this project, I went over important parts of css and javascript from previous lessons because must understand these methods and functions almost 100% to complete this project. Also, I looked up examples of Simon game from CodePen, Google search, Youtube video and GitHub for understanding overall structure, methods and function. Asked classmates and instructors when i get stuck on certain point.

##Unsolved Problem:

    1. Add timer for each stages, and setup a function that after certain amount of time game stops and automatically reset.
    2. Some part of code still need to keep DRY & KISS.
    3. Need more practice on keep order of codes clean and organized.
    4. Try to add different sound effect for each color square button.
    5. Need more practice on "for loop" and "if, else if".
    6. Try to change type of "document.getElementById" to jQuery way.
    7. Add sound effect when game started.

##User Stories:

    1. As a user, if i press restart button, the game is automatically start again.
    2. As a user, if i get the sequence wrong, display shows Game over, and let me try again.
    3. As a user, i can hear a buzz sound if i press wrong square button, and restart the game.
    4. As a user, i can hear a sound when i press the square buttons.
    5. As a user, i will try to match a sequence of blinking lights, by clicking them one-by-one in the same order.
